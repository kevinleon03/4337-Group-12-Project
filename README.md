# **4337 Group 12 Project**
A project built to predict if an English Premier League can comeback from a half time loss to rescue at least a point. The positive observations are those where a team losing at half time comeback to either win or draw at full time. 

## **Layout** 
This project has four python files, two csv files and one text file. The text file is an overview of every attribute in the dataset. EPL2014-2024.csv is the full dataset. filtered.csv is what the data that is used by the models looks like. This data is obtained in each python file which is obtained by filtering only the matches where comebacks occurred. The four python files are for all the models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, One Layer Perceptron, Multi Layer Perceptron.

## **Usage**
To run this code there is no special requirements other than installing the appropriate libraries: sklearn, pandas and matplotlib.
